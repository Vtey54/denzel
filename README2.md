You can launch the api by going to denzel/server/node_modules and do : nodemon ../../index.js

When the server is launched you can :
-Use RESTAPI queries with your browser or Insomnia to test different endpoints ( you can find exemple of instructions on ApiCommand file)
-Use GraphQL queries with your browser on http://localhost:9292/graphql ( once again you can find exemple of instructions on ApiCommand)
-Launch React server with npm start on react-api and get a random movie each time you refresh the page.
(/!\ Make sure the server is launched and ready to be used before using the React part or it won't display any movie)
